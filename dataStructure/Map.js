/* now what the heck is map and how do we use this datastructure in javascript */

can have diffent types of keys lets check it with example  */

the current set metjhod has all the map properties as i have displayed here in the last one  */

/* let me explain very important thing when i do console.log(randomMap) though its a map 
and we know that the basic differnce between map and object  in js is map key will alwasy be in 
string type though if we decalre 123 as a key behind the scene the js engin will convert that to 
string type but the map is different when ever  you declare  key data type 
js wont touch it it remain that but if map work this way they why the fuck when console.log(map )
it give me every key & value pair both are inside the string this isbecause js want to be 
eye soothing js potray the map key and value both in string but behind the scene its in its origonal 
data type i hope it make sense if no then the best you can do is give up ! hahahahah ðŸ˜‚ */
